##About myself
In the beginning, I was learning Python. I tried to create a website for a store and even made/created a bot that could send me my schedule for the day. In the process of creating the website, I realized that the front-end development is clearer and easier for me. I really enjoyed playing with the css tools. 
######I am very purposeful and diligent. I stay calm in any unexpected situations and I can always cheer up people around me.
