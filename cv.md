about myself
In the beginning, I learned the python programming language, tried to build a store and even made a bot that would throw off my lesson schedule for the day. In the process of creating a store, I realized that the front-end is clearer and easier for me, I really enjoyed playing with the css tools. I am very purposeful, assiduous, calm to any fatal situations and can always raise the morale of the team.
